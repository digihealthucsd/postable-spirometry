## User-Assembled Vortex Whistle Spirometer

# About Project:
3D printed vortex whistles have been shown to be an accessible alternative to clinical spirometers, the most common pulmonary function test to assess lung health. While more accessible than the current standard, the question remains of how to get the whistles to users for their own personal use. The novelty of this project is the proposal and demonstration of our idea of making the vortex whistle out of a postcard so it can be simply mailed to users. This work demonstrates the potential for a spirometer system to be mass-deployed in the form of a postcard. The results demonstrate that the use of oilboard does not compromise the performance of the device, and can thus serve as a mass-screening tool. As such, Postable Spirometry can serve as a truly ubiquitous pulmonary function testing solution. This work inspires the larger vision that other smartphone accessories or attachments can also be constructed out of paper, creating a fleet of Postables. Postables will enable the wide scale deployment of ubiquitous smartphone accessories.

# About this repo:
In an effort to open source our work to share our progress with others, this repo contains software used for analysis (frequency to flow velocity pipeline) as well as the hardware designs. The laser cut designs, and settings to print with, can be viewed and accessed by users. Feel free to print these designs on your own machines and try it out!
